# cnc-pcb-line-test-pattern
A test pattern with different line widths and margins for CNC milling of PCBs.

The python script was used to generate the pattern, but not the kicad_pcb file (just the last section of the file).

The line widths in the patter are 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, 24, 30, 40 mils with margins of 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 mils.

TODO #1. Fix this image :P
